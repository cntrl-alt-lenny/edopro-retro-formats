"""Structural provider-neutrality scanner.

Enforces that a project's *lane identity* — its roles, branch namespaces, task
queues and dispatch topology — is derived from ROLES and never from whichever
provider, model or tool happens to be running a seat this round.

DESIGN NOTE, and it is the entire point of this module.

A guard built from a list of known provider names is worthless against the next
provider. Every rule here is instead expressed as a POSITIVE invariant over the
caller's declared role set, and FAILS CLOSED on anything it does not recognise.
A provider that has never existed is therefore rejected by default, with no edit
to this file.

`GRAMMAR_QUALIFIERS` is the one allowance, and it is a closed set of English
function words — not a vendor list. A test asserts it contains no proper nouns,
so it cannot quietly become one.

HISTORICAL TEXT IS OUT OF SCOPE. Case studies, round logs, archived briefs and
failure catalogues record which tool actually ran. That is a record of events,
never a lane definition. Callers pass only their *normative* surface.

COUNTEREXAMPLE BLOCKS. A normative document sometimes needs to quote a banned
form in order to prohibit it. Wrap it and declare the structural violation it
demonstrates:

    <!-- guard:counterexample -->
    <!-- guard:violation compound-lane roles=builder text="Acme Builder" -->
    ... text that SHOULD be rejected ...
    <!-- /guard:counterexample -->

The declaration names the exact offending text and the roles with which it is
invalid. The probe runs that text through the real scanner with those declared
roles, not the adopting project's roles. A missing, absent or unflagged
declaration is inert. Findings inside such a block are suppressed by the outer
scan but still reported separately, so `ScanResult.inert_counterexamples()` can
make a useless exemption fail.
