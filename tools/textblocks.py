"""Join soft-wrapped Markdown into logical lines.

Prose in this repository is hard-wrapped at about 80 columns, so a sentence
routinely spans two physical lines. A detector that reads one physical line at a
time then sees fragments — and any rule that depends on words appearing near
each other breaks in both directions:

  * **False positive.** "You do not\\nmerge it." — the negation is on the
    previous line, so the second line reads as a permission. This was a real
    failure of the authority guard, caught by its own test suite.
  * **False negative.** "the SomeProvider\\nWorker" — the compound never appears
    on one line, so a lane-identity rule misses it.

`logical_lines` joins continuation lines within a paragraph or a list item, and
keeps genuinely separate block elements — table rows, headings, fence lines,
block quotes, list item starts — apart. Each result carries the physical line
number where it began, so findings still point at a real place in the file.

#: A normative document sometimes needs to quote a banned form in order to
#: prohibit it, or to name what a guard catches. Wrap it and declare each
#: structural violation explicitly:
#:
#:     <!-- guard:counterexample -->
#:     <!-- guard:violation compound-lane roles=builder text="Acme Builder" -->
#:     ... text that SHOULD be rejected ...
#:     <!-- /guard:counterexample -->
#:
#: The neutrality probe validates the declaration with the real scanner and the
#: roles named there; it never guesses from surrounding prose. Findings inside
#: are suppressed, but callers still get the blocks back so they can assert
#: every block actually contains something the guard rejects. An exemption that
#: protects nothing is a silent widening.

#: one. Table rows and list items must stay separate: joining them would let a
#: negation in one row silence a permission in the next.

#: Words that turn a statement about a thing into a statement PROHIBITING it.
#: Both guards need this: correct documents talk about merging and about queues
#: constantly, in the form "never merges", "no queue", "may not merge". A match
#: preceded by one of these is the shape we want to see, not a violation.
#: Word boundaries are load-bearing: without them "another" contains
#: "not" and "nonetheless" contains "none", so half the prose in a
#: normative document would silently count as a prohibition and the guards
#: would stop reporting anything. tests/test_guard_honesty.py pins this.
