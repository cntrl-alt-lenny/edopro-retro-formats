# Starting and running a round

The owner's side of the loop, written so a project can be picked up from
**completely fresh sessions** with no conversation history anywhere.

Everything else in this framework describes what the roles do. This describes
what the *owner* does, and it is deliberately short: two or three things to
paste, depending on whether the project has a standing Verifier, and nothing to
remember between them.

## The loop

```
Brain ──> Builder ──> [Verifier] ──> Brain ──> …
  │          │             │              │
  │          └── does the work            └── adjudicates, merges what it
  │                        └── reviews delivered work  accepts, starts the next round
  └── decides what is next, writes the prompts the topology needs
```

Where the topology has a standing Verifier, Brain may issue **both** prompt
blocks in the same turn, but it labels their order explicitly: the owner sends
the Builder prompt first and sends the Verifier prompt only after the Builder
has finished. Where there is no standing Verifier, Brain issues only the
Builder prompt. The Verifier does not wait or poll for delivery: once its
prompt is sent, it runs the mechanical check using a completion report whose
task and head match the branch and a branch strictly advanced beyond the base.
It never reviews the base. If delivery is not established, it stops and says
**"not delivered yet"**; the owner sends the Verifier prompt again after the
Builder has finished and delivery is available.

## 1. Starting Brain

Open a fresh session in the project and paste this. It is the same text for
every project and every tool:

```
You are the Brain for this project.

Read AGENTS.md first, then docs/agents/roles/brain.md, which is your contract
— follow it. Then rehydrate: derive the live repository state yourself rather
than trusting any document's claims about it, and check whether a round is
already in flight.

Then tell me, in plain English:
  1. where the project actually stands;
  2. what the next round should be, and why that one;
  3. the Builder prompt, as a single self-contained block I can paste;
  4. if and only if this project has a standing Verifier seat, the Verifier
     prompt as a separate self-contained block I can paste; otherwise say that
     no Verifier prompt is needed.

I will run those prompts in fresh sessions as this project's topology requires
and come back when they report.
```

If there is a standing Verifier, send the Builder block first. Send the
Verifier block only after the Builder has finished; preparing both blocks in
one Brain response does not change that order. Do not rely on either session
to wait or poll.

That is the entire kickoff. It names no tool, no model and no provider, and it
works on any seat that can read the repository and run git.

**If Brain's session cannot read the repository**, say so — it cannot hold this
seat, because rehydration is the first thing its contract requires. Move Brain
to a session with repository access rather than pasting state in by hand.

## 2. Running the Builder and the Verifier

Paste the Builder block Brain produced into its own fresh session and checkout
first — see [`git-and-isolation.md`](git-and-isolation.md). If there is a
standing Verifier seat, paste its separately labelled block only after the
Builder has finished. If there is no standing Verifier seat, paste only the
Builder block.

The Verifier's prompt names the branch and base rather than a commit that may
not exist yet. Its contract tells it to run the delivery check, which requires
the Builder's report provenance and a branch strictly advanced beyond the base,
then resolve the exact head SHA itself. If delivery is not established in that
session, it stops and says **"not delivered yet"**; the owner sends the same
Verifier prompt again once the Builder has finished and delivery is available.
The loop therefore never depends on a session choosing to wait or poll: the
Verifier reviews one literal delivered commit, never the base merely because
the branch exists.

## 3. Coming back to Brain

Return to the same Brain session — or a completely fresh one, which is the
point of all this — and paste:

```
The Builder has finished. If this project has a standing Verifier, I sent the
Verifier prompt only after the Builder finished; if it said "not delivered
yet", I sent that prompt again once delivery was available and it has now
finished. Re-derive the current state and adjudicate the round: accept it and
merge, or reject it with a corrective brief. Then give me the next prompt or
prompts this topology needs.
```

Brain re-derives rather than trusting what it remembers, reads both reports as
evidence rather than as verdicts, independently re-checks the load-bearing
claims, and then merges or rejects. It reports what it did in plain English.

**A fresh Brain works as well as a continuing one.** If a session is lost, or
the context is stale, or you would rather start clean, open a new one and paste
the kickoff from step 1 — Brain reconstructs everything from the repository.
That is a designed property, not a fallback: see *The repository is the memory*
in the [constitution](CONSTITUTION.md).

## If a report never arrives

A missing report means **unknown** — never that the work failed. Tell Brain
what you know and let it check; [`reports.md`](reports.md) sets out what it
does then, and why "no commit and no report" cannot be read as failure.

## Naming

This document says **Builder** because that is the common case: one executor
seat that implements. The name is the project's to choose in its `AGENTS.md` —
`Builder`, `Worker`, `Decomper`, `Researcher`, or several specialists at once.
Whatever it is called, it holds the executor contract in
[`roles/worker.md`](roles/worker.md), unchanged. Brain uses the project's
declared name in the prompts it writes, so the owner never has to translate.

## What the owner never has to do

Read a diff. Understand a SHA, a branch, or a worktree. Interpret CI. Decide
whether an implementation is technically correct. Approve a routine merge.

If any of those turns up in the loop, that is a defect in the framework rather
than a task for the owner — see the constitution's *operating model*. The
owner decides what gets built and can veto or reverse anything; deciding
whether the work is *correct* is Brain's job.
